      <title>Enabling EpocCam with MS Teams</title>

      <description>For work I use the communication platform MS Teams, which makes having a webcam kind of mandatory. Since I used to work with my laptop in clamshell mode, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to use the internal webcam. That&amp;rsquo;s when I discovered EpocCam, a software, which makes it possible to use a smartphone as webcam. Using your smartphone is not only pretty convenient but has also very good quality when compared with a standard webcam.</description>

      <title>Enabling additional languages for spell checking in Sublime Text 3</title>

      <description>I often use Sublime Text 3 for creating LaTeX documents. When doing so I really need spell checking for my texts to avoid producing gibberish. Fortunately that feature is already included, only dictionaries have to be added to support you preferred language.
Here you can find basic information on how to achieve that from the official homepage.
Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t self explanatory to me. To get new dictionaries working, go to https://github.</description>
