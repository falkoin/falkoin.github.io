      <title>Changing handbrake&#39;s automatic aspect ratio</title>

      <description>From time to time I do screen recordings, which include a PowerPoint with an aspect ratio of 4:3. When encoding these video files with handbrake it tries to be smart about it and tries to automatically detect the aspect ratio of the video, which usually ends up being 4:3 and cropping the rest of the video. But there is an easy fix for that. Go to the picture tab and change the cropping option to 0 in all directions.</description>

      <description>Creating the photo section for this blog I had the need to resize many images at once. Sure enough, I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to do this by hand and also found it cumbersome to create a batch process in an image manipulation program like Affinity Photo or Photoshop.
After a quick web-search I stumbled upon the tool sips.
sips -Z 2000 *.jpg This command resizes all jpg files in a folder to a maximum height or width of 2000, while keeping the aspect ratio.</description>

      <title>Enabling EpocCam with MS Teams</title>

      <description>For work I use the communication platform MS Teams, which makes having a webcam kind of mandatory. Since I used to work with my laptop in clamshell mode, I wasn&amp;rsquo;t able to use the internal webcam. That&amp;rsquo;s when I discovered EpocCam, a software, which makes it possible to use a smartphone as webcam. Using your smartphone is not only pretty convenient but has also very good quality when compared with a standard webcam.</description>

      <title>Enabling additional languages for spell checking in Sublime Text 3</title>

      <description>I often use Sublime Text 3 for creating LaTeX documents. When doing so I really need spell checking for my texts to avoid producing gibberish. Fortunately that feature is already included, only dictionaries have to be added to support you preferred language.
Here you can find basic information on how to achieve that from the official homepage.
Unfortunately it wasn&amp;rsquo;t self explanatory to me. To get new dictionaries working, go to https://github.</description>
